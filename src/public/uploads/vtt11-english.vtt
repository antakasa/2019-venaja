There is a document online from 1994.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.400
It is signed by Yuri Luzhkov
who was the mayor then.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.920
The document is about a waste crisis

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.520
that is caused by
the lack of waste landfills in Moscow.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.040
In good old Soviet style, it says

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.720
that the waste landfills in Moscow
can only be used for three more years.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.720
Unless the problem is solved
in 30 years,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.000
an accident cannot be avoided.
